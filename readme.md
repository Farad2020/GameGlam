## GameGlam on .Net Core 5
GameGlam is an application that helps it users to find giveaways of different types, and find additional information about them.

##Deeper look to a functionality
The idea is to create a web application that gets data from online web API called "GamerPower" and use it for this project.
From that, get all the data and simply use it for this app. Mainly, my app works as a kind of gateaway for a third party API.

The project uses MVC pattern, which hopefully doesn't require explanation

##Side Note:

The working version of the application is located inside GameGlamer folder

Folder GameGlam contains very early version of the app

GameGlamer.Test contains unit tests for this application

##The currently used tools

["GamerPower" web API](https://rapidapi.com/digiwalls/api/gamerpower)

[Json Formatting tool](https://json2csharp.com/)

Bootstrap 4

JQuery

And some other Microsoft frameworks like Identity or Entity
